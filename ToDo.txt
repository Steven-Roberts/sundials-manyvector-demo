Remaining items for "completion" of initial demonstration code:

* Fluid tests:
  a. simple linear advection [1D] ("entropy convection")
  b. SOD shock tube [1D] -- see Greenough & Rider JCP 2004
  c. Hurricane-like flow evolution with critical rotation [2D] (has exact solution) -- see Pan et al Num. Math. Theor. Meth. Appl. 2017, section 3.2.1-1
  d. Rayleigh-Taylor instability [2D] -- see Liska & Wendroff SISC 2003, or Pan et al Num. Math. Theor. Meth. Appl. 2017, section 3.3
  e. Interacting bubbles -- see Yang and Cai SISC 2013, section 6.1.2
  f. Implosion problem [2D] -- see Liska & Wendroff SISC 2003, section 4.7
  g. Explosion problem [2D] -- see Liska & Wendroff SISC 2003, section 4.8
  h. Double mach reflection problem [2D] -- see Andreyev final report, section 4.2.2

* HDF5 parallel I/O, with restart capabilities.  Store current
  solutions as well as current time and step size to HDF5 files.  On
  restarts, create ARKStep solver as usual, but set initial step size
  to match stored value.

* Chemical species:
  a. Add support for "nc" chemical species to be advected along with
     fluid (at fluid time scale); these should be initially stored in
     N_Vector_Serial on each process, and grouped along with
     ManyVector.  Include in this serial N_Vector a temperature
     "correction" field, that begins each slow step with zero-valued
     initial condition, and that donates all energy back to fluid at
     each fluid RHS call.
  b. Add reaction network based on DIRK solver and dense/band direct
     solver.  Test this on its own by creating/evolving/freeing an
     ARKStep solver at each fluid time step, in a simple
     operator-split fashion.
  c. Couple chemistry to fluid via MRIStep module.
  d. Convert chemical reaction network and inner DIRK solver to reside
     on GPU.  This will initially retain control structures on CPU,
     but do 'number crunching' for RHS, Jacobian and linear solves on
     GPU.

* Viscosity: add fluid viscosity, treated implicitly with ARK method
     at slow time scale.  Precondition/solve the corresponding linear
     systems with HYPRE.  This must wait until MRIStep has
     capabilities for solving multirate problems with implicitness at
     the slow time scale.
